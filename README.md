# 5e-Spell-Viewer
A simple WPF app I wrote for viewing and managing spells in 5e. Allows for the creation of characters and the addition of custom spells.

To install, simply run the Setup.exe file on the release page.

To Build from source, just open the .sln file in Visual Studio and build the project.
